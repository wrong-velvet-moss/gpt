        Llama and Mistral use RMS normalisation, where it drops the mean subtraction entirely.

        It drops the mean subtraction (mean centering) and the beta shift parameters.

        Where we divide each input by the rms and scale by gamma.

        The insight form the paper, in layernorm was not normalised by mean subtraction.
        Rescaling by a mag measure.
